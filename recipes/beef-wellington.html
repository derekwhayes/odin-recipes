            <li>2 tablespoons red wine</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F</li>
            <li>Stick the beef chunk in a small baking dish. Lather 2 tbsps<br>
                butter on beef</li>
            <li>Bake that loaf of meat until browned, 10 to 15 minutes.<br>
                Remove and allow to cool. Reserve meat juice.</li>
            <li>Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tbsps butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute<br>
                onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. Remove and cool.</li>
            <li>Mix together liver paste and 2 tbspns of butter in a bowl;<br>
                season with salt and pepper. Spread gooey mixture on beef. Top<br>
                with onion and mushroom mix</li>
            <li>Roll out puff pastry dough to about 1/4 inch thickness and<br>
                place beef in the middle. Fold up and seal all the edges,<br>
                making sure the seams are not too thick. Place the BEEF in a<br>
                9x13 inch baking dish, cut a few slits in the top dough, and<br>
                brush with egg yolk</li>
            <li>Bake in oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 425 degrees F and<br>
                continue baking until pastry is a rich, golden brown, 10 to 15<br>
                minutes. Set aside and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Place the reserved meat juice in a small saucepan over high<br>
                heat. Stir in beef broth and red wine; boil until slightly<br>
                reduced, 10 to 15 minutes. Strain and serve.</li>
